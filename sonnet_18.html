    <p>
        <strong><em>Shall</em></strong> I compare thee to a summer’s day?
        <br> Thou art more lovely and more temperate:
        <br> Rough winds do shake the darling buds of May,
        <br> And summer’s lease hath all too short a date:
    </p>
    <p>
        Sometime too hot the eye of heaven shines,
        <br> And often is his gold complexion dimm’d;
        <br> And every fair from fair sometime declines,
        <br> By chance, or nature’s changing course, untrimm’d:
    </p>
    <p>
        But thy eternal summer shall not fade,
        <br> Nor lose possession of that fair thou ow’st;
        <br> Nor shall Death brag thou wander’st in his shade,
        <br> When in eternal lines to time thou grow’st:
    </p>
    <p>
        So long as men can breathe, or eyes can see,
        <br> So long lives this, and this gives life to thee.
    </p>
